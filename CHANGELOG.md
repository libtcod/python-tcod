# Changelog

Changes relevant to the users of python-tcod are documented here.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) since version `2.0.0`.

## [Unreleased]

## [19.3.0] - 2025-07-26

### Added

- `tcod.sdl.render`: Added `ScaleMode` enum and `Texture.scale_mode` attribute.

## [19.2.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added

- `tcod.noise.grid` now has the `offset` parameter for easier sampling of noise chunks.

## [19.1.0] - 2025-07-12

### Added

- Added text input support to `tcod.sdl.video.Window` which was missing since the SDL3 update.
  After creating a context use `assert context.sdl_window` or `if context.sdl_window:` to verify that an SDL window exists then use `context.sdl_window.start_text_input` to enable text input events.
  Keep in mind that this can open an on-screen keyboard.

## [19.0.2] - 2025-07-11

Resolve wheel deployment issue.

## [19.0.1] - 2025-07-11

### Fixed

- `Console.print` methods using `string` keyword were marked as invalid instead of deprecated.

## [19.0.0] - 2025-06-13

Finished port to SDL3, this has caused several breaking changes from SDL such as lowercase key constants now being uppercase and mouse events returning `float` instead of `int`.
Be sure to run [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) on your projects to catch any issues from this update.

### Changed

- Updated libtcod to 2.1.1
- Updated SDL to 3.2.16
  This will cause several breaking changes such as the names of keyboard constants and other SDL enums.
- `tcod.sdl.video.Window.grab` has been split into `.mouse_grab` and `.keyboard_grab` attributes.
- `tcod.event.KeySym` single letter symbols are now all uppercase.
- Relative mouse mode is set via `tcod.sdl.video.Window.relative_mouse_mode` instead of `tcod.sdl.mouse.set_relative_mode`.
- `tcod.sdl.render.new_renderer`: Removed `software` and `target_textures` parameters, `vsync` takes `int`, `driver` takes `str` instead of `int`.
- `tcod.sdl.render.Renderer`: `integer_scaling` and `logical_size` are now set with `set_logical_presentation` method.
- `tcod.sdl.render.Renderer.geometry` now takes float values for `color` instead of 8-bit integers.
- `tcod.event.Point` and other mouse/tile coordinate types now use `float` instead of `int`.
  SDL3 has decided that mouse events have subpixel precision.
  If you see any usual `float` types in your code then this is why.
- `tcod.sdl.audio` has been affected by major changes to SDL3.
  - `tcod.sdl.audio.open` has new behavior due to SDL3 and should be avoided.
  - Callbacks which were assigned to `AudioDevice`'s must now be applied to `AudioStream`'s instead.
  - `AudioDevice`'s are now opened using references to existing devices.
  - Sound queueing methods were moved from `AudioDevice` to a new `AudioStream` class.
  - `BasicMixer` may require manually specifying `frequency` and `channels` to replicate old behavior.
  - `get_devices` and `get_capture_devices` now return `dict[str, AudioDevice]`.
- `TextInput` events are no longer enabled by default.

### Deprecated

- `tcod.sdl.audio.open` was replaced with a newer API, get a default device with `tcod.sdl.audio.get_default_playback().open()`.
- `tcod.sdl.audio.BasicMixer` should be replaced with `AudioStream`'s.
- Should no longer use `tcod.sdl.audio.AudioDevice` in a context, use `contextlib.closing` for the old behavior.

### Removed

- Support dropped for Python 3.8 and 3.9.
- Removed `Joystick.get_current_power` due to SDL3 changes.
- `WindowFlags.FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` is now just `WindowFlags.FULLSCREEN`
- `tcod.sdl.render.Renderer.integer_scaling` removed.
- Removed `callback`, `spec`, `queued_samples`, `queue_audio`, and `dequeue_audio` attributes from `tcod.sdl.audio.AudioDevice`.

### Fixed

- `Joystick.get_ball` was broken.

## [18.1.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added

- `tcod.path.path2d` to compute paths for the most basic cases.

### Fixed

- `tcod.noise.grid` would raise `TypeError` when given a plain integer for scale.

## [18.0.0] - 2025-04-08

### Changed

- `Console.print` now accepts `height` and `width` keywords and has renamed `string` to `text`.
- Text printed with `Console.print` using right-alignment has been shifted to the left by 1-tile.

### Deprecated

- In general the `fg`, `bg`, and `bg_blend` keywords are too hard to keep track of as positional arguments so they must be replaced with keyword arguments instead.
- `Console.print`: deprecated `string`, `fg`, `bg`, and `bg_blend` being given as positional arguments.
  The `string` parameter has been renamed to `text`.
- `Console.print_box` has been replaced by `Console.print`.
- `Console.draw_frame`: deprecated `clear`, `fg`, `bg`, and `bg_blend` being given as positional arguments.
- `Console.draw_rect`: deprecated `fg`, `bg`, and `bg_blend` being given as positional arguments.
- The `EventDispatch` class is now deprecated.
  This class was made before Python supported protocols and structural pattern matching,
  now the class serves little purpose and its usage can create a minor technical burden.

## [17.1.0] - 2025-03-29

### Added

- SDL renderer primitive drawing methods now support sequences of tuples.

### Fixed

- `tcod.sdl.Renderer.draw_lines` type hint was too narrow.

  boost to speed in CPython and a drastic to boost in speed in PyPy.

## [1.2.0] - 2015-06-06

- The set*colors method now changes the default colors used by the draw*\*

- You can now configure or disable key repeating with tdl.event.setKeyRepeat
- Typewriter class removed, use a Window instance for the same functionality.
- setColors method fixed.

## [1.1.4] - 2013-03-06

- Merged the Typewriter and MetaConsole classes,
  You now have a virtual cursor with Console and Window objects.

- clear method now defaults to black on black.

## [1.1.1] - 2012-12-05

- Map submodule added with AStar class and quickFOV function.
- New Typewriter class.
- Most console functions can use Python-style negative indexes now.
- New App.runOnce method.
- Rectangle geometry is less strict.

## [1.1.0] - 2012-10-04

- MouseButtonEvent.button now behaves like KeyEvent.keyname does.
- event.App class added.
- Drawing methods no longer have a default for the character parameter.
- KeyEvent.ctrl is now KeyEvent.control

## [1.0.8] - 2010-04-07
