This directory contains a few example scripts for using python-tcod.

`samples_tcod.py` is the mail example which uses most of the newer API.  This
can be compared to `samples_libtcodpy.py` which mostly uses deprecated
functions from the old API.

Examples in the `distribution/` folder show how to distribute projects made
using python-tcod.

Examples in the `experimental/` folder show off features that might later be
added the python-tcod API.  You can use those features by copying those modules
into your own project.
